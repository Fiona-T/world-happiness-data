## Purpose
---
The [World Happiness Reports](https://worldhappiness.report/) are annual publications which interpret and draw conclusions from data collected from people in over 150 countries. 

The World Happiness Data tool is a command-line application allowing users to look up a dataset containing the happiness scores from the World Happiness Reports over the years 2005 to 2020 inclusive. For example, to look at data for a particular country so that they can see how the happiness score changed over time. 

The application provides the requested data to the user by printing it to the terminal. The application will also display a graph representing the requested data, also printed in the terminal. 

The target market is relatively broad. In general, it would be people with a passing interest in the Happiness Reports, perhaps piqued when the results are announced each year in the general news. It is not aimed at people with in depth knowledge of the Happiness Reports nor those who want to do in depth data visualisations. The usefulness of the tool lies in the ability to quickly extract information from the large dataset. 

### User’s goals:
- the users of the tool want to access the happiness scores for a country or countries, within the years 2005 - 2020 
- the user may also want to view a graph representing the happiness scores over time for a country

### Site owner’s goal:
- the goal of this tool is to provide an easy way for users to get different information from the World Happiness historical scores dataset.
